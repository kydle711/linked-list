# linked-list
An implementation of a doubly linked list in C

My plan is to improve this to include dynamically allocated memory, which will allow the user to build the linked list interactively through the command line. Then, I will add other functions for inserting at specific indices, popping from indices, searching for elements, and maybe even sorting.
